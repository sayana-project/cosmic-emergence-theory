# Validation Code for Cosmic Emergence Theory

This directory contains Python code for numerical validation and testing of the Cosmic Emergence Theory predictions.

## Files

### `test_validation_cosmologique.py`
Main validation script that:
- Simulates 1 million random wave interferences
- Calculates phase differences and classifications
- Compares results with theoretical 5-27-68 distribution
- Provides statistical validation within 1% tolerance

### `debug_interferences.py`
Debugging script that:
- Analyzes mathematical foundations of interference calculations
- Identifies potential errors in theoretical formulation
- Provides detailed step-by-step verification
- Exposes fundamental assumptions in the model

### `test_validation_cosmologique_sans_graphique.py`
Simplified version without graphical dependencies:
- Pure numerical validation
- Compatible with systems lacking matplotlib
- Provides same statistical accuracy as main script

## Usage

```bash
python test_validation_cosmologique.py
python debug_interferences.py
python test_validation_cosmologique_sans_graphique.py
```

## Dependencies
- numpy (required for all scripts)
- matplotlib (required only for main validation script)
- Standard Python libraries

## Key Results

All scripts consistently show:
- Constructive interference probability: ~12.5% (theoretical target: 5%)
- Partial interference probability: ~25% (theoretical target: 27%)
- Destructive interference probability: ~62.5% (theoretical target: 68%)

## Note on Mathematical Discrepancy

The validation reveals a significant mathematical discrepancy between the theoretical predictions and actual wave interference physics. This suggests either:
1. The original theoretical formulation needs refinement
2. Additional physical mechanisms beyond simple wave interference
3. Non-linear effects not captured in current model

This discrepancy is documented in the theory papers as an area requiring further investigation.
